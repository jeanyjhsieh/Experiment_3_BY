<p>What is the research study about?</p>

<p>
You are invited to take part in this research study. The research study aims to understand how the brain processes different kinds of information in the images that we see. You have been invited because you signed up for the study through the SONA online system. Please read this form to understand what the study involves, and ask the researcher if you have further questions.
</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>Who is conducting this research?</p>

<p>
The study is being carried out by Professor Colin Clifford, Dr Erin Goddard and other researchers within the School of Psychology at UNSW. This research is funded by the Australian Research Council.
</p>

<li>
<p>What does participation in this research require, and are there any risks involved?</p>

<p>
You will be shown images and animations on your computer screen and asked to report simple attributes of what you see by pressing keys on the computer keyboard.

There are no major potential risks involved in participation in this study. The only slightly uncomfortable side effect you might experience is eye fatigue from looking at a computer screen. However, this is minimized by providing self-paced break opportunities throughout the experiment.
</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>Total participation time</p>
<p>
In total, participation in this study will require about 30 minutes.

</li>

<li>
<p>What are the possible benefits to participation?</p>

<p>
We cannot promise that you will receive any benefits from this study, but we hope to use the findings from this study to better understand how the brain processes visual information about the world around us.
</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>What will happen to information about me?</p>

<p>
Any information that is obtained in connection with this study and that can be identified with you will remain confidential and will be disclosed only with your permission or except as required by law. Identifiable information that we collect includes your name. We will record information about the type of browser used to complete the experiment (e.g., Chrome version 81) and the type of device used to complete the experiment (e.g., Mac OSX version 10.15). The information that you give us will be kept for a minimum of 5 years after the projectâ€™s completion. We will store information about you on computers only accessible to the research team.

If you give us your permission by clicking the button below, we plan to publish the results of the study as part of an article in scientific journals. We may also present the results at scientific conferences or discuss the general results of the experiment in the media. We may also make data collected during the experiment accessibly publicly (e.g., via an online data repository) so that other researchers can perform their own analyses on the data. In all of these cases, data will be published, discussed, or provided in such a way that you cannot be personally identified.
</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>How and when will I find out what the results of the research study are?</p>
<p>
The research team intend to publish and/or report the results of the research study in a variety of ways. All information published will be done in a way that will not identify you. If you would like to receive a copy of the aggregate results of the study you can let the research team know by checking the box below. We will only use your contact information (email address linked to SONA) to send you the results of the research.
