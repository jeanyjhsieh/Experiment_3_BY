<li>

<p>
What kind of study is it, e.g., descriptive, correlational?
</p>

<p>
In this study, you saw a series of images on the screen, and made responses to indicate what you saw. The study has an experimental design. We manipulated certain attributes of the images (called independent variables) to see what effect this had on your responses (the dependent variable).
</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>
What are the independent variables? How are you operationalizing them?
</p>

<p>
The independent variables that we manipulated were properties of the images 
(e.g., orientation of a line, face’s direction of gaze, etc.). These properties are manipulated using graphical software, which allows us to control attributes very precisely (e.g., the software can generate an image of a face looking exactly 5 degree to the right, or a line tilted at exactly 22.5 degrees).
</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>
What are the dependent variables that were measured? How are you operationalizing them?
</p>

<p>
The dependent variables in this study were your reports of your perception of particular attributes of the image. We operationalized your perception of the images by asking you to respond with a specific categorical judgment, such as “The face was looking at me” or “The line was tilted to the right”.
</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>
What is one potential confounding variable and how have you attempted to control for it?
</p>

<p>
Images may look very different under different illumination conditions. To control for the influence of illumination variation, we used a database of images where the illumination was consistent thus ensuring control over how faces or objects are illuminated.
</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>
What is one potential ethical issue, and how has the experimenter attempted to resolve it?
</p>

<p>
One ethical issue common to most research performed with human participants is participant confidentiality. As is standard practice in research, any publications arising from this study will not include any personal information about the participants that would allow them to be identified (e.g., their names).
</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>
How did the experimenter get from first year psychology to conducting this research?
</p>

<p>
As an example career path in psychology, one of the experimenters, Dr Colin Palmer, completed an undergraduate course in Psychology and Neuroscience at Monash University in Melbourne, followed by a PhD investigating differences in perceptual experience in autism spectrum disorder. He is now a postdoctoral researcher at UNSW Sydney, working on social aspects of vision (e.g., perception of others’ eye gaze).
